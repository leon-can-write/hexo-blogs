# Specify users for repositories

Sometimes we need to assign a different user for the repository, and push it to remote with this user account.

<!--more-->

First we do the routine that:
- create a ssh key
- upload ssh key to github
- open bash and type in `ssh-agent bash` to start ssh-agent
- type in `ssh-add ./blog_id_rsa` to add the ssh key


Then we edit `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host leon-can-write
  HostName github.com
  User leon-can-write
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blog_id_rsa
```


Next step is optional. We set local username & email. Enter the local git repository, then type:
```bash
git config user.email leon-can-write@live.com
git config user.user leon-can-write
```
to set up email and user. Note that there is no `--global` or `--local` since the default option is `--local`.


Finally we tell git which entry to use in the ssh config file:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@leon-can-write:leon-can-write/hexo-blogs.git
#                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^---------
#                                 Host            git         repository
#                                              username
```
